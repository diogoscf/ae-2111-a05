Can we force everyone to use Black?
Use python 3.11

NB:When importing variables or functions from another file, use filename.function_or_variable

Variables:
XFLRData_# -> Array of data from XFLR at # deg AOA
y_lst -> List of y values 
c_lst -> List of Chord lengths at 
cl_lst_# -> List of Cl values at # deg AOA
cd_lst_# -> List of Cd values at # deg AOA
cm_lst_# -> List of Cm values at # deg AOA
CL_0 -> lift coefficient of the wing at 0 degrees AOA = 0.320243
CL_10 -> lift coefficient of the wing at 10 degrees AOA = 1.115382
CL_d -> lift coefficient at specific flight regime
root_chord -> root chord length in meters
taper_ratio -> taper ratio
half_span -> half span of the wing
spanwise_location -> spanwise location expressed in meters (always give positive values when used in functions)
Wing_Surface -> Wing Surface area (m^2)

Functions:
interpolater(y_pos, listtype) -> Interpolates data from XFLR files. Y_pos indicates the y_position of where you want to evaluate. listtype changes the list that is interpolated

lift_distribution_specific_flight_regime -> returns a numpy array that contains the lift coefficient distribution along the wingspan in a certain flying regime; it takes as input CL_0, CL_10, CL_d, cl_lst_0, cl_lst_10

AOA_specific_flight_regime -> return the angle of attack the airplane is flying at a certain flight regime in RADIANS; it takes as input CL_0, CL_10, CL_d

chord -> return the length of the chord at a certain spanwise location in meters; it takes as input root_chord, taper_ratio, half_span, spanwise_location
^You also get chord from the interpolater usng c_lst

Plot_lift_distribution(CL_d) -> plots the lift distribution of any given CL

Cl_at_y(CL_d, y_pos) -> Gives local Cl for any given CL and y position
