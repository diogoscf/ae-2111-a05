Can we force everyone to use Black?
Use python 3.11

XFLRData -> Array of data from XFLR
y_lst_# -> List of y values at # deg AOA
c_lst_# -> List of Chord lengths at # deg AOA
cl_lst_# -> List of Cl values at # deg AOA
cd_lst_# -> List of Cd values at # deg AOA
cm_lst_# -> List of Cm values at # deg AOA
CL_0 -> lift coefficient of the wing at 0 degrees AOA = 0.320243
CL_10 -> lift coefficient of the wing at 10 degrees AOA = 1.115382
CL_d -> lift coefficient at specific flight regime

interpolater(y_pos, listtype) -> Interpolates data from XFLR files. Y_pos indicates the y_position of where you want to evaluate. listtype changes the list that is interpolated
lift_distribution_specific_flight_regime -> returns a numpy array that contains the lift coefficient distribution along the wingspan in a certain flying regime; it takes as input CL_0, CL_10, CL_d, cl_lst_0, cl_lst_10
AOA_specific_flight_regime ->
